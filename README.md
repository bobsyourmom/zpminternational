ZPM International is a manufacturer of SMR (Small Modular Reactor) related components.

It has recently experienced a large influx of capital due to the popularity of green energy and government committments to eliminating carbon based emissions.

The CISO understands the sensitivity on the public perceptions over nuclear power and wants to be sure his team doesn't contribute to any negative press that could affect their stock value.

As such he has acquired a substantial budget for upgrading the company's security posture.

The following objectives must provide the foundation of these security upgrades:

	- Include a migration path from on-prem to the Cloud (Azure, and/or AWS and/or GCP).
	- The solution must be based on well accepted security architecture frameworks.
		○ Use the NIST 802.53 cybersecurity framework as part of the solution.
		○ Map NIST to whatever security framework is provided by the chosen cloud vendor.
	- A zero trust model should be considered where relevant.

Additional requirements will follow, but every solution must include references to a cybersecurity framework. This will make it much easier to perform audits on the security infrastructure when needed.
